# List challenge!
# First create 2 seperate lists.
# One list should have a list of names

# another list should have a list of grades

# Loop through through both list so that you print the name and the grade on seperate lines like this:
#   Ben : 89
#   Jack: 100
#   Sam: 55
#   Julie: 90



#Lastly add all the grades together and give the average of grades and print out the following:
#  Class average is: {average}



# **** Hints *****
# Making a list ->   list = {}
# For loops ->   for something in range():
# printing with variables ->   print(f"{variable}")
